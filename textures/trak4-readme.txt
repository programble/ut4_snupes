--------------------
A set of weathered industrial/grunge textures, mostly 512x with normal, bump, and specular maps.
Please note that the specular maps and some of the normalmaps for these textures are completely untested, and may look rather suboptimal.

bump(offset) maps are in the alpha channel of the *_nm normalmaps. Speculars are in *_s. If anyone converts these to fit other
standards, let me know and I'll mirror the alternate packs on my website.

----------------

The pack was inspired partly by Yan 'Method' Ostretsov's texture work, as well as by the photos from Opacity.us.
Many thanks to both :)

This pack is a variant of my TRaK4 texture pack (originally licensed as cc-by), which omits certain textures
that are incompatible with the MIT/X11 license. The original pack is available on my website.

Source .psd files are also included for easy modification, under the MIT license as stated below.

Feel free to contact me about alternative licensing, but please note that I have no intention of releasing this pack 
under a 'strong copyleft' license such as the GNU GPL.
